# TH04-Tic-Tac-Toe
Full Stack Java Script Project 04 - Treehouse TechDegree

## Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game

In this project, you'll build a functional, two-person tic-tac-toe game. You'll use the provided mockups, HTML, CSS and image files to create a game that requires players to add their names, take turns adding an X or O to the game board, and announce when the game ends. You'll need to keep track of the state of the game -- who's turn it is, where the X's and O's are on the board, and whether the game is a draw or, if not, who won and lost.

Download the project files. We've several files to help with this project

<p>Use the supplied mockup files and HTML snippets to guide you in building a Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can use jQuery or plain JavaScript to complete this project. 

<p>Add the game play following standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Play alternates between X and O.</li>
<li>The current player is indicated at the top of the page
<li>When the current player mouses over an empty square on the board, it's symbol the X or O should appear on the square. You can do this using the x.svg or o.svg graphics (hint use JavaScript to set the background-image property for that box.)</li>
<li>Players can only click on empty squares. 
<li>The game ends when one player has three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If all of the squares are filled and no players have three in a row the game is a tie.</li>
<li>Add programming so that when the game ends, the board disappears and the game end screen appears. Use the tictactoe-03-winner1.png and tictactoe-04-winner2.png mockups, and the win.txt HTML snippet for guidance. Depending on the game results the final screen should:
Show the word "Winner" or "It's a Tie!"</li></ul>


## Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

2 steps
<ul>
        <li>Let a player add their name before the game starts</li>
        <ul>
                    <li>Name appears while the game is playing</li>
                    <li>The name is displayed for the winning player</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Add programming to </strong>support playing against the computer. Only one player plays, the other is controlled by your programming.</li>
</ul>
